## Course Discription
During the transition to the modern age, the ideology of "Confucianism" was frequently disregarded as an antiquated artifact. However, in contemporary times, it is seeing a resurgence of attention and scholarly exploration in diverse domains like as philosophy, religion, politics, and culture, spanning both Eastern and Western contexts. The resurgence of "Confucianism" in contemporary intellectual discourse can be attributed to its inherent adaptability, as it functioned as both a body of knowledge and a set of ethical guidelines that grew in response to the demands of different historical contexts, rather than rigidly sticking to preexisting notions and procedures. 
When contemplating Confucianism, it is commonly associated with the practice of meditative stillness as a means to achieve mental tranquility. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that intellectual exploration, aimed at comprehending evolving circumstances and resolving challenges, has consistently constituted a significant facet of Confucianism across its historical development. This course aims to provide an introduction to the latest information and methodologies in coding. Students will have the opportunity to apply these techniques to a topic of their choosing, with the objective of analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating the results. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between traditional Confucian methodologies, such as 下學上達, 思學竝進, and 修己治人, and their relevance in contemporary society.
