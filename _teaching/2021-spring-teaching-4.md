## Course Discription
This class aims to make a new interpretative attempt on the text of modern and contemporary Korean literature by applying various analytical methodologies of quantitative language analysis based on the database of modern and contemporary Korean literature data accumulated so far.  
In this class, as in the subtitle of the class, certain categories of modern and contemporary literary texts are grouped (this can be a writer-specific, ideological terrain, or literary orientation). We would like to cluster the text with the criteria of language, place, and time to examine the characteristics. This semester's class will start with a 신소설. We plan to digitize the works of Lee In-jik (이인직), Lee Hae-jo (이해조), and Choi Chan-sik (최찬식), the representative writers of the 신소설 and conduct a study to compare the linguistic characteristics of each author and map the place and time in the text.  
The original text entry and contrast work will be carried out using the Wiki platform and will be released so that anyone can see the digitized works. After working on the literature, we use Python to analyze the form of the form, extract keywords, and learn the machine. Final research results drawn at the end of the semester will also be posted on Wiki.
