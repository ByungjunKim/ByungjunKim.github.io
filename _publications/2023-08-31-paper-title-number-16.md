## Abstract
Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a large Korean sentence set with varying degrees of semantic predictability that can be used for testing speech recognition and lexical processing.  
Method: Sentences differing in the degree of final-word predictability (predictable, neutral and anomalous) were created with words selected to be suitable for both native and non-native speakers of Korean. Semantic predictability was evaluated through a series of cloze tests in which native (n = 56) and non-native speakers (n = 18) of Korean participated. The present study also used a computer language model to evaluate final-word predictabilities. In a speech recognition task, the sentences were presented to native (n = 23) and non-native speakers (n = 21) of Korean in speech-shaped noise at two levels of noise.  
Results: The results of the speech-in-noise experiment demonstrated that the intelligibility of the sentences was similar to that of related English corpora. That is, intelligibility was significantly different depending on the semantic condition, and the sentences had the right degree of difficulty for assessing intelligibility differences depending on noise levels and language experience.  
Conclusions: This corpus (1021 sentences in total) adds to the target languages available in speech research and will allow researchers to investigate a range of issues in speech perception in Korean.
