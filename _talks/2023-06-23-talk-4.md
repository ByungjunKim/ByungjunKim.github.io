## Abstract
This paper examines the global reaction to the Netflix original series Squid Game as a way of investigating who the actual authority to lead popularity has in the global OTT era. Three groups of online Squid Game opinions were established for this purpose: Media Elites Group (MEG), Online Influencers Group (OIG), and General Online Users Group (GOUG). We utilized data from online comments on IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and English mainstream media articles. The following are the outcomes of the topic modeling and vector autoregression analyses. First, in contrast to the general public, including OIG and GOUG, MEG focused on social issues, whereas OIG and GOUG were interested in work-related issues. Second, based on an examination of who the primary definer is among the three groups, the OIG and GOUG led MEG. Additionally, GOUG led OIG. Using these two results, we were able to consider the publicâ€™s role in influencing content opinions in the era of OTT services.
