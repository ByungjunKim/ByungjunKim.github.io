## Abstract
This presentation will elucidate the structure and utility of the OpenAlex database, emphasizing its relevance to computational literary studies and digital intellectual history. Initially, I will delineate the data architecture of OpenAlex, providing a foundational understanding of its capabilities and structure. Subsequently, I will illustrate the application of OpenAlex through recent research examples within the domains of digital humanities and computational social sciences, demonstrating its pivotal role in advancing scholarly inquiries. Lastly, I will share Python [code](https://github.com/ByungjunKim/LODinG_OpenAlex) that facilitates the integration of the OpenAlex API with Linked Open Data (LOD), highlighting practical methods for leveraging this technology in research environments.
