## Abstract
City of Seoul has endeavored to realize smart city by automatically processing people’s complaints reported through online channels. This study examined the voices of citizens of Seoul through the contents of Seoul’s civil complaints and suggestions platform, “Oasis of Ten Million Imaginations.” Citizens in Seoul are trying to improve their quality of life by giving clues on how they feel about Seoul. Using Word2vec and semantic network analysis, the authors conducted 1) an automatic classification of complaints into designated categories and 2) semantic clustering of what was said based on the various categories. Results indicate that random forest algorithm may be of help in automatically detecting and classifying what people say, and the semantic network results may be used to reorganize government institutions based on civil demands. Policy implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.
